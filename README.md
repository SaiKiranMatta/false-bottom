# False Bottom Encryption Algorithm

This package is an implementation of the **False Bottom** encryption algorithm, which is a deniable encryption scheme. Deniable encryption allows users to deny the existence of certain messages or information, even if they possess the key to decrypt them.

## Features

- **Deniable Encryption**: Users can convincingly deny the existence of specific messages.
- **Secure Randomness**: Utilizes cryptographic random values to ensure security.
- **TypeScript Compatibility**: Written in TypeScript for improved type safety and developer experience.

## Installation

You can install the package using npm. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install false-bottom
